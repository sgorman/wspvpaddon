Errors:
PvP_TargetFrame - has some kind of error in it, copy/paste errors so we can look at them later.

PvP_Nameplates  - White line is infront of health bar of npc units.
		- Health bar for guards isnt the correct length, it is too short
		- the nameplate name colors sometimes unsync and go white.
