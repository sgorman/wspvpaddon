Errors:
PvP_TargetFrame 
		- has some kind of error in it, copy/paste errors so we can look at them later.
		- Healthbar colors associated with npc's seems to fade and become darker. Not sure why, It might have to do with the sprite.

Thins Scott noticed:

When I ignite on my SS it doesnt show the debuff on my target.
	- the debuff bar is in the "Mana bar" part of the target frame. The black space.
