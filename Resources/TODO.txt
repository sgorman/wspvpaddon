Errors:
PvP_TargetFrame - has some kind of error in it, copy/paste errors so we can look at them later.
		- Healthbar colors associated with npc's seems to fade and become darker. Not sure why, It might have to do with the sprite.

PvP_Nameplates  - White line is infront of health bar of npc units.
				- Health bar for guards isnt the correct length, it is too short
				- the nameplate name colors sometimes unsync and go white.
				- Shield percentage sometimes disappears from players
					- might have fixed this. Let me know if you see this happen anymore
